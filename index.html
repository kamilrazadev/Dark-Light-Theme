                <h3>What are the causes of cancer?</h2>
                <p class="para">
                    There are an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases globally, and cancer remains the second-leading cause of death in the United States, where more than 1.7 million people are diagnosed with cancer every year. Cancer is often discussed as if it’s one thing. But while unrestrained growth is the common denominator, cancer can develop in a variety of different ways, due to a variety of different factors. Some we inherit, and others we are exposed to throughout our lives. It can be categorized into hundreds of different diseases based on the cells in which it arises. And when each patient’s genetic background is taken into account, no two cases are identical.

                <h3>When Does Cancer Occur?</h3>
                <p class="para">
                    Cancer begins when cells acquire the ability to grow uncontrollably and ultimately invade and damage the body’s normal tissues. Cancer development happens in multiple stages, from precancerous changes to malignant tumors. However, not all cancers form tumors, and different cancers can develop at different rates. Sometimes cancer cells spread from their original site to other places in the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system—a process called metastasis.

                <h3>Behavioral Causes of Cancer</h3>
                <p class="para">
                    There are a number of behavioral factors that can lead to genetic mutations and, as a result, lead to the development of cancer.
                    <ul class="para">
                        <li>Tobacco</li>
                        <li>Tanning (excessive exposure to ultraviolet light)</li>
                        <li>Diet (red, processed meats)</li>
                        <li>Alcohol</li>
                        <li>Inflammatory conditions, such as ulcerative colitis or obesity</li>
                    </ul>   
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="para">
                    In addition to other factors associated with aging and senescence, older individuals are more likely to have had exposure to environmental risk factors and are therefore diagnosed with cancer much more frequently than young people. When it comes to children with cancer, new immunotherapy approaches are providing for the possiblity of treating them not only more effectively, but also without some of the damaging side effects that can accompany conventional treatments.
